# Part-of-Speech
In English language, words can be categorized according to their syntactic functions, which is known as "Part of Speech".
Examples of part of speech: (noun, verb, adjective, ...).
My task is to make an interactive activity using React.js, node.js, and Express.js that helps the students practice categorizing a set of words according to their part of speech.

## Note:
I created a simple change and this is in the Practice Screen when an option got selected, the student should press the next button and after this the student should get a feedback whether his/her answer was correct or incorrect.
